### Things I learned during this trimester:
- how to use psuedo code to write my thoughts down before coding 
- I learned how to use simulations effectively in my code
- how to use libraries to sort many things
- How to use HTML for the baseline on how my code should look.
- how to use an api using javascript and fetch code from the backend using the frontend
- how to use lists and dictonaries in python
- How to use sources like Chat gpt to help me learn how to code and many differences.
- I learned how to make differences in coding things
- learned how to work as a team and how to communicate with others
- I Learned how to do many things like make code better through debugging code.
- Learned that when you are passionate about something you are more likely to do it.
- Even when infringing on other code we would have to copy and paste code
- Figured out how to use an API online into my code using the fetch commands 

### Accomplishments:
- Learned how functionality worked in css to java when using script tags in a HTML file
- Learned how to code mostly in java and python to make my website.
- Added an apple to the snake game that kills you when you touch it.
- I learned how to code for the first time in python
- Learned how to start problem solving with code currently.
- Made new friends for new groups next trimester and connections with others so I could code
- Created a new API

## Takeaways
- I saw that coding is not only something tht you do on your own it is something that you do with others.
- I can percieve code well and understand code well but when I understand code it is better to put into my own words.
- I saw that teachers will only help o specific problems that you have and not to ask General problems


## Plans 
In the future I plan to integrate the clash royale API to actually having a visual that has a card vs card simulation for my Personal Plans. I am also looking to develop many things like a personal repository. I also plan to look ahead for the  AP exam and keep on taking practice tests. I am also looking to do many thing like plan out every week a little more in depth for what I am doing.
