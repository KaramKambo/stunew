Wednesday: I did things like trying to get VS code.
Thursday: I had to update my computer
Friday: I updated my computer but it still was not working and then I figured it out

## Problems
Some of the problems that I encountered were that I did not have my computer up to date.

## What I learned
Something that I learned is that Vs Code neds to connect to the github directory.
